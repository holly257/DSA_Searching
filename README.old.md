1. How many searches?
    - Given a sorted list 3, 5, 6, 8, 11, 12, 14, 15, 17, 18 and using the recursive binary search algorithm, identify the sequence of numbers that each recursive call will search to try and find 8.
        - first time returns 3,5,6,8,11 => 11 is halway and doesn't match
        - second time 6,8,11 => 6 is halfway and doesn't match
        - third time 6,8 => 8 would match being the halfway point
